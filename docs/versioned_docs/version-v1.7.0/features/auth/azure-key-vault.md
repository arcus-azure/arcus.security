# Authentication with Azure Key Vault

The authentication mechanisms page is moved towards an [dedicated page](../secret-store/provider/key-vault.md) that explains how the Azure Key Vault can be added as a secret provider to the secret store.

More information in the secret store can be found [here](../secret-store/index.md).
